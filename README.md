###  Canada Crop Yield Prediction based on GIS data

The project involved developing a model to predict crop yields using Canadian crop yield and geospatial weather data. The goal was to estimate the relationship between weather data and crop yields based on geographical location, using various machine learning algorithms. To achieve this,Google BigQuery public data was used in this project. The XGBoost model was one of the machine learning algorithms applied. The model achieved a remarkable 95% accuracy rate in its predictions.
