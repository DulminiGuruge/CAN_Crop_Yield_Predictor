###  Canada Crop Yield Prediction based on GIS data

The project involved developing a model to predict crop yields using Canadian crop yield and geospatial weather data. The goal was to estimate the relationship between weather data and crop yields based on geographical location using various machine-learning algorithms. Google BigQuery public data was used in this project to achieve this. The XGBoost model was one of the machine learning algorithms that was applied. The model achieved a remarkable 95% accuracy rate in its predictions.
